The MediaEval 2019 Workshop brings together the participants of the [MediaEval 2019 benchmarking campaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophia_Antipolis) to report on their findings, discuss their approaches, and learn from each other.

The MediaEval Workshop will be held October 27-October 29 in [Sophia Antipolis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophia_Antipolis) at [EURECOM](http://www.eurecom.fr/en).

This year, the workshop also offers a "bonus day" on 30 October. Stay for this day if you are interested in evaluation methodology, if you are planning to organize a task in 2020, or if you working on disaster management research, and would like to present and/or discuss MMSat and plan for next year.
