title: The 2019 Predicting Media Memorability Task
subtitle: Predicting Media Memorability
# required info
layout: default
year: 2019
call: This task focuses on the problem of predicting how memorable a video is to viewers. It requires participants to automatically predict memorability scores for videos that reflect the probability a video will be remembered. Task participants are provided with an extensive dataset of videos that are accompanied by memorability annotations, as well as pre-extracted state-of-the-art visual features. The ground truth has been collected through recognition tests, and thus results from objective measurement of memory performance. Participants will be required to train computational models capable of inferring video memorability from visual content. Optionally, descriptive titles attached to the videos may be used. Models will be evaluated through standard evaluation metrics used in ranking tasks (Spearman’s rank correlation). The data set used in 2019, is the same as in 2018 (2018’s testset ground truth data has not been released). This year the task focuses on understanding the patterns in the data and improving the ability of algorithms to capture those patterns.
