title: NewsFire Discovering the triggers for viral news stories
year: 2019
category: task_force

Participants receive a large corpus of news stories and social media posts (text and images) and are required to build a system that detects the original triggers of news that spread with a viral or wildfire pattern. They are encouraged to develop “news graphs” in which the nodes represent content items and the edges represent topical relationship or topical influence. If you are interested in the work of a task force and would like to have more information about what is being planned, or would like to get involved, please contact Konstantin Pogorelov at konstantin (at) simula.no
