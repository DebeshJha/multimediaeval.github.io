MediaEval is a benchmarking that offers challenges in multimedia retrieval, access and exploration. Our mission is to allow researchers working in computer science and other multimedia related field an opportunity to work on tasks that are related to human and social aspects of multimedia. MediaEval emphasizes the 'multi' in multimedia and seeks tasks involving multiple modalities, e.g., audio, visual, textual, and/or contextual. Our larger aim is to promote reproducible research that makes multimedia a positive force for society.

Thank you everyone for a successful and interesting workshop. A very special word of appreciation to EURECOM for hosting us. The [MediaEval 2019 Workshop Program](http://multimediaeval.org/docs/MediaEval19_Program.pdf) is available online, and other material will become available in the coming weeks.
