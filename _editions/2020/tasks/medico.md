subtitle: Semantic polyp segmentation
blurb: The fight against colorectal cancer requires better diagnosis tools. Computer-aided diagnosis systems can reduce the chance that diagnosticians overlook a polyp during a colonoscopy. This task focuses on robust and efficient algorithms for polyp segmentation. The data consists of a large number of endoscopic images of the colon.

#### Challenge Description
Colonoscopy is a standard medical procedure for the examination of colon cancer. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most prevailing strain in terms of cancer incidence and second in terms of mortality globally. Regular screening through colonoscopy is a prerequisite for early cancer detection and prevention of colorectal cancer. Regardless of the achievement of colonoscopy in reducing the cancer burden, the estimated adenoma miss rate is around 6-27%. An automated computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system could be one of the potential solutions for the overlooked polyps. Such detection or surveillance system can help low-cost design solutions and save doctors time, which they could use to look for severe cases. 

Common datasets and benchmarking of the methods are essential for developing automated semantic segmentation approaches for clinical translation. The "Medico automatic polyp segmentation task" aims to develop a computer-aided diagnosis system for an automatic polyp segmentation that can detect all polyp (for example, irregular polyp, smaller or flat polyps) with high accuracy. The main goal of the challenge is to benchmark semantic segmentation algorithms on the publicly available dataset, with a specific emphasis on robustness and generalization of the methods to solve the limitation related to data availability and method comparison.
