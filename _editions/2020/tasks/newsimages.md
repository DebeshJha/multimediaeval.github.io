#### Task Description
News articles use both text and images to communicate their message. Online news is no exception. The overall goal of this task is to better understand the relationship between images accompanying news articles and the textual content of the articles (including text body, and headlines) and to understand the impact of these elements on readers’ interest in the news (measured by the number of views). 

The task requires the extraction of features from visual images and textual descriptions. Participants must analyze the features' correlation concerning the context, noise, and the topic domain.

This task provides a sizeable real-world dataset of news items, each consisting of textual features (headline, snippet) as well an image (and high-level features computed based on the image). The participant should learn patterns/models describing the relation between the images and the texts as well as the news items and the user interest in the news items (number of views).
